---

**athena** is a personal experiment to recreate the general look & feel as well as functionality of the [Modrinth desktop app](https://modrinth.com/app) [theseus](https://github.com/modrinth/code/tree/main/apps/app), but in a [fork](https://github.com/gold-meridian/axolotl) of [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework).

The purpose of this project is to battle-test [axolotl](https://github.com/gold-meridian/axolotl) and to develop a practical project with it to ensure it covers the bases for a GUI app.
